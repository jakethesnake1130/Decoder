# Decoder
Project that takes encrypted text and reveals the hidden message.
Takes text encrypted with a Caesar cipher (such as the one found here https://md5decrypt.net/en/Caesar/#results) and reverses the encryption.
Demonstrates use of file input/output with Java, along with a few other tricks needed to get the program working.
